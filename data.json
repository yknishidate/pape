            "abstract": "In a spatially augmented reality system, multiple projectors are tiled on a complex shaped surface to create a seamless display on it. This has several applications in visualization, gaming, education and entertainment. The main challenges in creating seamless and undistorted imagery on such complex shaped surfaces are geometric registration and color correction. Prior methods that provide solutions for the spatial color variation in multi-projector displays assume rectangular overlap regions across the projectors that is possible only on flat surfaces with extremely constrained projector placement. In this paper, we present a novel and fully automated method for removing color variations in a multi-projector display on arbitrary shaped smooth surfaces using a general color gamut morphing algorithm that can handle any arbitrarily shaped overlap between the projectors and assures imperceptible color variations across the display surface.",

            "abstract": "Recently, we have witnessed a boom in applications for 3D talking face generation. However, most existing 3D face generation methods can only generate 3D faces with a static head pose, which is inconsistent with how humans perceive faces. Only a few articles focus on head pose generation, but even these ignore the attribute of personality. In this article, we propose a unified audio-driven approach to endow 3D talking faces with personalized pose dynamics. To achieve this goal, we establish an original person-specific dataset, providing corresponding head poses and face shapes for each video. Our framework is composed of two separate modules: PoseGAN and PGFace. Given an input audio, PoseGAN first produces a head pose sequence for the 3D head, and then, PGFace utilizes the audio and pose information to generate natural face models. With the combination of these two parts, a 3D talking head with dynamic head movement can be constructed. Experimental evidence indicates that our method can generate person-specific head pose sequences that are in sync with the input audio and that best match with the human experience of talking heads.",

So far a few 3D caricature generation methods exist and all of them require some caricature information (e.g., a caricature sketch or 2D caricature) as input. This kind of input, however, is difficult to provide by non-professional users. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network model that generates high-quality 3D caricatures directly from a normal 2D face photo. The most challenging issue for our system is that the source domain of face photos (characterized by normal 2D faces) is significantly different from the target domain of 3D caricatures (characterized by 3D exaggerated face shapes and textures). To address this challenge, we: (1) build a large dataset of 5,343 3D caricature meshes and use it to establish a PCA model in the 3D caricature shape space; (2) reconstruct a normal full 3D head from the input face photo and use its PCA representation in the 3D caricature shape space to establish correspondences between the input photo and 3D caricature shape; and (3) propose a novel character loss and a novel caricature loss based on previous psychological studies on caricatures. Experiments including a novel two-level user study show that our system can generate high-quality 3D caricatures directly from normal face photos.",

To date, traffic visualization via different simulation models can reconstruct detailed traffic flows. However, each specific behavior of vehicles is always described by establishing an independent control model. Moreover, mutual interactions between vehicles and other road users are rarely modeled in existing simulators. An all-in-one simulator that considers the complex behaviors of all potential road users in a realistic urban environment is urgently needed. In this work, we propose a novel, extensible, and microscopic method to build heterogeneous traffic simulation using the force-based concept. This force-based approach can accurately replicate the sophisticated behaviors of various road users and their interactions in a simple and unified manner. We calibrate the model parameters using real-world traffic trajectory data. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through many simulation experiments, as well as comparisons to real-world traffic data and popular microscopic simulators for traffic animation.",

            "abstract": "During traditional surgeries, planning and instrument guidance is displayed on an external screen. Recent developments of augmented reality (AR) techniques can overcome obstacles including hand-eye discoordination and heavy mental load. Among these AR technologies, optical see-through (OST) schemes with stereoscopic displays can provide depth perception and retain the physical scene for safety considerations. However, limitations still exist in certain AR systems and the influence of these factors on surgical performance is yet to explore. To this end, experiments of multi-scale surgical tasks were carried out to compare head-mounted display (HMD) AR and autostereoscopic image overlay (AIO) AR, concerning objective performance and subjective evaluation. To solely analyze effects brought by display techniques, the tracking system in each included display system was identical and similar tracking accuracy was proved by a preliminary experiment. Focus and context rendering was utilized to enhance in-situ visualization for surgical guidance. Latency values of all display systems were assessed and a delay experiment proved the latency differences had no significant impact on user performance. Results of multi-scale surgical tasks showed that HMD outperformed in detailed operations probably due to stable resolution along the depth axis, while AIO had better performance in larger-scale operations for better depth perception. This paper helps point out the critical limitations of current OST AR techniques and potentially promotes the progress of AR applications in surgical guidance.",

These spatiotemporal datasets create opportunities for new visualizations to engage experts from different domains to study the dynamic behavior of urban spaces in this under explored dimension. However, designing 3D spatiotemporal urban visualizations is challenging, as it requires visual strategies to support analysis of time-varying data referent to the city geometry. Although different visual strategies have been used in 3D urban visual analytics, the question of how effective these visual designs are at supporting spatiotemporal analysis on building surfaces remains open. To investigate this, in this paper we first contribute a series of analytical tasks elicited after interviews with practitioners from three urban domains. We also contribute a quantitative user study comparing the effectiveness of four representative visual designs used to visualize 3D spatiotemporal urban data: spatial juxtaposition, temporal juxtaposition, linked view, and embedded view. Participants performed a series of tasks that required them to identify extreme values on building surfaces over time. Tasks varied in granularity for both space and time dimensions. Our results demonstrate that participants were more accurate using plot-based visualizations (linked view, embedded view) but faster using color-coded visualizations (spatial juxtaposition, temporal juxtaposition). Our results also show that, with increasing task complexity, plot-based visualizations perform better in preserving efficiency (time, accuracy) compared to color-coded visualizations. Based on our findings, we present a set of takeaways with design recommendations for 3D spatiotemporal urban visualizations for researchers and practitioners. Lastly, we report on a series of interviews with four practitioners, and their feedback and suggestions for further work on the visualizations to support 3D spatiotemporal urban data analysis.",

One common focus for these techniques has been the recommendation of content, rather than visual form, as a means to assist users in the identification of information that is relevant to their task context. A wide variety of techniques have been proposed to address this general problem, with a range of design choices in how these solutions surface relevant information to users. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in how visualization systems surface recommended content to users during users' visual analysis; introduces a four-dimensional design space for visual content recommendation based on a characterization of prior work; and discusses key observations regarding common patterns and future research opportunities.",

            "abstract": "Multiclass contour visualization is often used to interpret complex data attributes in such fields as weather forecasting, computational fluid dynamics, and artificial intelligence. However, effective and accurate representations of underlying data patterns and correlations can be challenging in multiclass contour visualization, primarily due to the inevitable visual cluttering and occlusions when the number of classes is significant. To address this issue, visualization design must carefully choose design parameters to make visualization more comprehensible. With this goal in mind, we proposed a framework for multiclass contour visualization. The framework has two components: a set of four visualization design parameters, which are developed based on an extensive review of literature on contour visualization, and a declarative domain-specific language (DSL) for creating multiclass contour rendering, which enables a fast exploration of those design parameters. A task-oriented user study was conducted to assess how those design parameters affect users' interpretations of real-world data. The study results offered some suggestions on the value choices of design parameters in multiclass contour visualization.",

            "abstract": "Standalone Virtual Reality (VR) headsets can be used when travelling in cars, trains and planes. However, the constrained spaces around transport seating can leave users with little physical space in which to interact using their hands or controllers, and can increase the risk of invading other passengers' personal space or hitting nearby objects and surfaces. This hinders transport VR users from using most commercial VR applications, which are designed for unobstructed 1-2m 360\u00b0 home spaces. In this paper, we investigated whether three at-a-distance interaction techniques from the literature could be adapted to support common commercial VR movement inputs and so equalise the interaction capabilities of at-home and on-transport users: Linear Gain, Gaze-Supported Remote Hand, and AlphaCursor. First, we analysed commercial VR experiences to identify the most common movement inputs so that we could create gamified tasks based on them. We then investigated how well each technique could support these inputs from a constrained $50\\mathrm{x}50\\text{cm}$ space (representative of an economy plane seat) through a user study $(\\mathrm{N}=16)$, where participants played all three games with each technique. We measured task performance, unsafe movements (play boundary violations, total arm movement) and subjective experience and compared results to a control \u2018at-home\u2019 condition (with unconstrained movement) to determine how similar performance and experience were. Results showed that Linear Gain was the best technique, with similar performance and user experience to the \u2018at-home\u2019 condition, albeit at the expense of a high number of boundary violations and large arm movements. In contrast, AlphaCursor kept users within bounds and minimised arm movement, but suffered from poorer performance and experience. Based on the results, we provide eight guidelines for the use of, and research into, at-a-distance techniques and constrained spaces.",

This problem is challenging due to the intrinsically complex, temporal relationship between music and human motion as well as the lacking of high quality music-playing motion datasets. In this article, we propose a fully automatic, deep learning based framework to synthesize realistic upper body animations based on novel guzheng music input. Specifically, based on a recorded audiovisual motion capture dataset, we delicately design a generative adversarial network (GAN) based approach to capture the temporal relationship between the music and the human motion data. In this process, data augmentation is employed to improve the generalization of our approach to handle a variety of guzheng music inputs. Through extensive objective and subjective experiments, we show that our method can generate visually plausible guzheng-playing animations that are well synchronized with the input guzheng music, and it can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, through an ablation study, we validate the contributions of the carefully-designed modules in our framework.",

            "abstract": "Designing thin-shell structures that are diverse, lightweight, and physically viable is a challenging task for traditional heuristic methods. To address this challenge, we present a novel parametric design framework for engraving regular, irregular, and customized patterns on thin-shell structures. Our method optimizes pattern parameters such as size and orientation, to ensure structural stiffness while minimizing material consumption. Our method is unique in that it works directly with shapes and patterns represented by functions, and can engrave patterns through simple function operations. By eliminating the need for remeshing in traditional FEM methods, our method is more computationally efficient in optimizing mechanical properties and can significantly increase the diversity of shell structure design. Quantitative evaluation confirms the convergence of the proposed method. We conduct experiments on regular, irregular, and customized patterns and present 3D printed results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

Due to the rich, detailed diagnostic data captured by distributed tracing tools, effectively presenting this data is important. However, use of visualisation to enable sensemaking of this complex data in distributed tracing tools has received relatively little attention. Consequently, operators struggle to make effective use of existing tools. In this paper we present the first characterisation of distributed tracing visualisation through a qualitative interview study with six practitioners from two large internet companies. Across two rounds of 1-on-1 interviews we use grounded theory coding to establish users, extract concrete use cases and identify shortcomings of existing distributed tracing tools. We derive guidelines for development of future distributed tracing tools and expose several open research problems that have wide reaching implications for visualisation research and other domains.",

            "abstract": "Large tree structures are ubiquitous and real-world relational datasets often have information associated with nodes (e.g., labels or other attributes) and edges (e.g., weights or distances) that need to be communicated to the viewers. Yet, scalable, easy to read tree layouts are difficult to achieve. We consider tree layouts to be readable if they meet some basic requirements: node labels should not overlap, edges should not cross, edge lengths should be preserved, and the output should be compact. There are many algorithms for drawing trees, although very few take node labels or edge lengths into account, and none optimizes all requirements above. With this in mind, we propose a new scalable method for readable tree layouts. The algorithm guarantees that the layout has no edge crossings and no label overlaps, and optimizing one of the remaining aspects: desired edge lengths and compactness. We evaluate the performance of the new algorithm by comparison with related earlier approaches using several real-world datasets, ranging from a few thousand nodes to hundreds of thousands of nodes. Tree layout algorithms can be used to visualize large general graphs, by extracting a hierarchy of progressively larger trees. We illustrate this functionality by presenting several map-like visualizations generated by the new tree layout algorithm.",

            "abstract": "Visual perception is a key component of data visualization. Much prior empirical work uses eye movement as a proxy to understand human visual perception. Diverse apparatus and techniques have been proposed to collect eye movements, but there is still no optimal approach. In this paper, we review 30 prior works for collecting eye movements based on three axes: (1) the tracker technology used to measure eye movements; (2) the image stimulus shown to participants; and (3) the collection methodology used to gather the data. Based on this taxonomy, we employ a webcam-based eyetracking approach using task-specific visualizations as the stimulus. The low technology requirement means that virtually anyone can participate, thus enabling us to collect data at large scale using crowdsourcing: approximately 12,000 samples in total. Choosing visualization images as stimulus means that the eye movements will be specific to perceptual tasks associated with visualization. We use these data to propose a Scanner Deeply, a virtual eyetracker model that, given an image of a visualization, generates a gaze heatmap for that image. We employ a computationally efficient, yet powerful convolutional neural network for our model. We compare the results of our work with results from the DVS model and a neural network trained on the Salicon dataset. The analysis of our gaze patterns enables us to understand how users grasp the structure of visualized data. We also make our stimulus dataset of visualization images available as part of this paper's contribution.",

            "abstract": "Human performance is poor at detecting certain changes in a scene, a phenomenon known as change blindness. Although the exact reasons of this effect are not yet completely understood, there is a consensus that it is due to our constrained attention and memory capacity: We create our own mental, structured representation of what surrounds us, but such representation is limited and imprecise. Previous efforts investigating this effect have focused on 2D images; however, there are significant differences regarding attention and memory between 2D images and the viewing conditions of daily life. In this work, we present a systematic study of change blindness using immersive 3D environments, which offer more natural viewing conditions closer to our daily visual experience. We devise two experiments; first, we focus on analyzing how different change properties (namely type, distance, complexity, and field of view) may affect change blindness. We then further explore its relation with the capacity of our visual working memory and conduct a second experiment analyzing the influence of the number of changes. Besides gaining a deeper understanding of the change blindness effect, our results may be leveraged in several VR applications such as redirected walking, games, or even studies on saliency or attention prediction.",

            "abstract": "The recent pandemic, war, and oil crises have caused many to reconsider their need to travel for education, training, and meetings. Providing assistance and training remotely has thus gained importance for many applications, from industrial maintenance to surgical telemonitoring. Current solutions such as video conferencing platforms lack essential communication cues such as spatial referencing, which negatively impacts both time completion and task performance. Mixed Reality (MR) offers opportunities to improve remote assistance and training, as it opens the way to increased spatial clarity and large interaction space. We contribute a survey of remote assistance and training in MR environments through a systematic literature review to provide a deeper understanding of current approaches, benefits and challenges. We analyze 62 articles and contextualize our findings along a taxonomy based on degree of collaboration, perspective sharing, MR space symmetry, time, input and output modality, visual display, and application domain. We identify the main gaps and opportunities in this research area, such as exploring collaboration scenarios beyond one-expert-to-one-trainee, enabling users to move across the reality-virtuality spectrum during a task, or exploring advanced interaction techniques that resort to hand or eye tracking. Our survey informs and helps researchers in different domains, including maintenance, medicine, engineering, or education, build and evaluate novel MR approaches to remote training and assistance.

We systematically reviewed the literature on devices tested to provide assistance to people with dementia during indoor, outdoor and virtual navigation (PROSPERO ID number: 215585). Medline and Scopus databases were searched from inception. Our aim was to summarize the results from the literature to guide future developments. Twenty-three articles were included in our study. Three types of information were extracted from these studies. First, the types of navigation advice the devices provided were assessed through: (i) the sensorial modality of presentation, e.g., visual and tactile stimuli, (ii) the navigation content, e.g., landmarks, and (iii) the timing of presentation, e.g., systematically at intersections. Second, we analyzed the technology that the devices were based on, e.g., smartphone. Third, the experimental methodology used to assess the devices and the navigation outcome was evaluated. We report and discuss the results from the literature based on these three main characteristics. Finally, based on these considerations, recommendations are drawn, challenges are identified and potential solutions are suggested. Augmented reality-based devices, intelligent tutoring systems and social support should particularly further be explored.",

            "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are pushing from the labs towards consumers, especially with social applications. These applications require visual representations of humans and intelligent entities. However, displaying and animating photo-realistic models comes with a high technical cost while low-fidelity representations may evoke eeriness and overall could degrade an experience. Thus, it is important to carefully select what kind of avatar to display. This article investigates the effects of rendering style and visible body parts in AR and VR by adopting a systematic literature review. We analyzed 72 papers that compare various avatar representations. Our analysis includes an outline of the research published between 2015 and 2022 on the topic of avatars and agents in AR and VR displayed using head-mounted displays, covering aspects like visible body parts (e.g., hands only, hands and head, full-body) and rendering style (e.g., abstract, cartoon, realistic); an overview of collected objective and subjective measures (e.g., task performance, presence, user experience, body ownership); and a classification of tasks where avatars and agents were used into task domains (physical activity, hand interaction, communication, game-like scenarios, and education/training). We discuss and synthesize our results within the context of today's AR and VR ecosystem, provide guidelines for practitioners, and finally identify and present promising research opportunities to encourage future research of avatars and agents in AR/VR environments.",
